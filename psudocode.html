I'm going to write this without reading from the homework readme file(I've read it a couple times already).

The idea behind this project is to create a number guessing game, with a theme of crystals.

1.The player will be presented with the number to be guessed. This number will be random from 19 - 120.
The player will have to click in four different image of crystals.
Each image will have a random number associated with it for the entire game. The number is not shown, the player must click on the image and remember the value of each image.
The numbers will be random from 1 - 12.
Whenever the number is reached or passed, the game will restart and one count will be added to a win or a loss variable.

That's pretty much it.
